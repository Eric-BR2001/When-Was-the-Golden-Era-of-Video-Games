# When-Was-the-Golden-Era-of-Video-Games
Let's use SQL to figure out the golden era of video games!

## Project Description
According to Mordor Intelligence, video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores, in addition to sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

## 🧠 SQL Queries & Analysis

### 🔝 Best Selling Games
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM game_sales 
ORDER BY games_sold DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### 🏆 Critics' Top Ten Years
```sql
SELECT 
  g.year, 
  COUNT(g.name) AS num_games, 
  ROUND(AVG(r.critic_score), 2) AS avg_critic_score
FROM 
  game_sales g
INNER JOIN 
  reviews r ON g.name = r.name
GROUP BY 
  g.year
HAVING 
  COUNT(g.name) >= 4
ORDER BY 
  avg_critic_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### ✨ Golden Years of Gaming
```sql
SELECT 
  u.year, 
  u.num_games, 
  c.avg_critic_score, 
  u.avg_user_score, 
  c.avg_critic_score - u.avg_user_score AS diff
FROM 
  critics_avg_year_rating c
INNER JOIN 
  users_avg_year_rating u ON c.year = u.year
WHERE 
  c.avg_critic_score > 9 OR u.avg_user_score > 9
ORDER BY 
  c.year ASC;
```
